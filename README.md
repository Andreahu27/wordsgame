A word-based riddle, inspired by popular game Wordle, in which users guess a secret word.

Users can choose the length of the secret word, the number of tries available, and make use of hints (in the form of definitions or descriptions of the secret word).

Words are picked randomly via a web service and user's guesses are checked for existence in an English dictionary.

Primarily designed for mobile, but compatible also with desktop.
